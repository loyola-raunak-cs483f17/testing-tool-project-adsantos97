## SOAPExample.zip (too big to fully upload to github)
   This zipped folder contains an example SOAP web service program.  
   The main java class that I had edited is DemoClass.java, which contains one method called sum, which takes in two int values, a and b. This method outputs the sum of the two numbers.  
   Update: I had uploaded SOAPExample.zip, but found out that it is too big to upload on to github. Instead, I have uploaded the DemoClass that contains the method that I typed up.
