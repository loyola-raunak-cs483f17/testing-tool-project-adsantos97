## SOAPExample.zip (too big to fully upload to github)
   This zipped folder contains an example SOAP web service program.  
   The main java class that I had edited is Calculator.java, which contains two methods called sum and product, both of which takes in two int values, a and b. The methods outputs the sum and product of the two numbers respectively.  
   Update: I had uploaded SOAPExample.zip, but found out that it is too big to upload on to github. Instead, I have uploaded Calculator.java that contains the methods that I typed up.
